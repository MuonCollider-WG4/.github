# Muon Collider WG4

Organisation to handle version controlled lattice description files and other data for the Muon Collider Front End

## Version Control

Version control should be handled using Branches. A new version should be deployed for every significant report, paper, etc. Versions come in two flavours:
* __prerelease__: this is a snapshot intended to aid sharing lattices. Not everything is necessarily cleaned, but it provides a way of clearly tagging a particular blob
* __release__: this is a new version of the lattice intended to represent a fully updated lattice. All files should be updated as needed.

Versions should be stored in branches like

> [date]-prerelease

> [date]-release

I expect that there will not be more than one (pre)release per day. 

To make a new Branch, go to your repo in github.com. Near the top of the page, under the repo heading, there will be a piece of text saying _3 branches_. This is a link - click on it to get into the branch view. There will be a big green button at the top right that says _New Branch_. Click this and enter the name of your new branch.

Here is an example of the demonstrator github area to see how it might look:
